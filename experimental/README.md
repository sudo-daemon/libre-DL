# This secton has been created to establish a clear roadmap of changes to be incorporated into libre-DL in the coming days.

Alpha- These versions contain untested code that I've just thought of adding. 

Beta- Alpha features move onto Beta when they have been successfully tested on at least one operating system

Stable- This is the main, thoroughly tested version that is present on the main page of this project. It has been tested on all three major operating systens; Linux, Windows and macOS.
